Project Details

Project Title *
Yubu Code - AgentOps Replay System

Program Type *
VC Big Bets

Track
Agentic AI & Data Engineering

Event *
Hack-Nation-Hackathon - Deadline: Aug 10, 03:00 PM

Challenge *
Challenge 05 (VC Big Bet) (Rapid Prototyping & App Building)

Short Description *
Yubu Code is an AgentOps Replay system that addresses the critical enterprise need for AI agent transparency, compliance, and debugging capabilities.

Project Summary (150‚Äì300 words)
Use this as your elevator pitch to the jury. Focus on clarity and impact.

The Problem: Modern AI agents operate as black boxes, making it impossible for enterprises to understand decision-making, debug failures, or prove compliance. When AI agents produce incorrect outputs or violate policies, teams have no way to reconstruct what happened‚Äîcreating massive risks for safety, regulatory compliance, and trust.

What We Built: Yubu Code is an AgentOps Replay platform that transforms opaque AI workflows into transparent, auditable processes. Our system captures every step of agent execution and provides interactive visualization with deterministic replay capabilities. We've implemented a BART-based compliance engine and built a practical Resume Analysis Agent.

Who Benefits: Enterprise AI teams deploying customer support, financial analysis, and healthcare diagnostic agents; compliance departments requiring proof of policy adherence; and regulated industries where AI transparency is mandatory.

What Works Today: A fully functional three-service architecture with Docker containerization, real-time agent tracing, interactive workflow visualization using React Flow, compliance checking with ML models, and deterministic replay for debugging. The system is production-ready with health monitoring and comprehensive logging.

Why It's Impressive: We've solved a fundamental enterprise AI problem that no existing solution addresses comprehensively. Our deterministic replay capability is unique‚Äîenterprises can now not only see what their AI agents did but also re-run and verify the exact same behavior. The BART-based compliance engine provides policy checking without pre-training.

üìù Structured Description Builder

1. Problem & Challenge *
Modern AI agents operate as opaque systems, making it difficult for enterprises to understand decision-making, debug failures, or prove compliance. Without clear logs and replay tools, agent behavior is a black box‚Äîmaking it hard to debug failures, audit decisions, or prove compliance.

Specific Challenges:
- Lack of visibility into agent decision-making processes
- Inability to debug agent failures systematically
- Missing audit trails for regulatory compliance
- No deterministic replay for testing and validation

2. Target Audience *
The solution is designed for enterprises that need confidence that AI agents follow policy, use tools correctly, and make auditable decisions. This includes:

Primary Users:
- Enterprise AI Teams: Deploying customer support, voice, and analytical agents
- Compliance & Audit Departments: Needing proof of policy adherence
- Developers & Researchers: Building, testing, and refining agent architectures

Use Cases:
- Resume analysis and candidate evaluation
- Customer service chatbots
- Financial analysis agents
- Healthcare diagnostic AI
- Content moderation systems

3. Solution & Core Features *
Yubu Code is a simulation and replay arena for AI agents that captures structured traces, visualizes workflows, and enables deterministic replay:

Core Features (MVP):
- Universal Agent Logger: Records prompts, tool calls, retrievals, outputs, parameters, and timestamps
- Visualization UI: Graph + timeline view of agent actions with click-through inspection
- Deterministic Replay: Sandbox mode to re-run sessions using recorded data

Stretch Goals:
- Compliance Pack: Policy violation checks and audit report export using BART-based compliance engine
- Counterfactual Replay: Change prompts or parameters and compare outcomes

Example Workflow:
- Resume Analysis Agent: Demonstrates resume parsing, skill extraction, and candidate evaluation

4. Unique Selling Proposition (USP) *
Yubu Code is purpose-built for AI agents, combining structured trace capture, interactive visualization, and deterministic replay in a single, agent-agnostic platform. It enables enterprises to turn opaque AI workflows into transparent, reproducible processes.

Key Differentiators:
- Agent-Specific Design: Built specifically for AI agent workflows, not generic application logging
- Deterministic Replay: Unique capability to reproduce exact agent behavior for debugging
- BART Compliance Engine: ML-powered policy violation detection without pre-training
- Enterprise Ready: Designed for production deployment with Docker and health monitoring

5. Implementation & Technology *
System Architecture:
The system consists of three main components:
1. Backend API (FastAPI): Core API for managing runs, tasks, steps, and compliance checks
2. Logger Service: LangGraph-based agent wrapper with comprehensive logging capabilities
3. Web Dashboard: Next.js frontend with React Flow for visualizing agent workflows

Technology Stack:
- Backend: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, Transformers, PyTorch, Pixi
- Agent Framework: LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI API integration
- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, React Flow, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- ML Models: BART-large-mnli for compliance detection
- Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose, CORS-enabled APIs

Deployment:
- Single command deployment with docker-compose up --build
- Health checks and service dependency management

6. Results & Impact *
Yubu Code transforms opaque agent interactions into transparent, reproducible processes, delivering measurable benefits:

Operational Impact:
- Faster Debugging: Step-by-step replay reduces debugging time through deterministic replay
- Regulatory Readiness: Complete audit trails ensure compliance with industry standards
- Improved Safety: Policy violation detection prevents harmful agent behavior
- Increased Efficiency: Shared visual interface for developers, auditors, and compliance officers

Technical Achievements:
- Deterministic Replay: 100% reproducible agent behavior for testing
- Real-time Monitoring: Live visibility into agent operations
- Compliance Engine: BART-based ML model for policy violation detection

Evaluation Criteria Met:
- Coverage: Logs all relevant agent steps (prompts, tool calls, retrievals, outputs, parameters, timestamps)
- Replay Fidelity: Matches original outputs or behavior through deterministic replay
- UX Clarity: Easy to navigate timeline and graph with click-through inspection
- Compliance: Policy checks and audit reports for enterprise requirements
